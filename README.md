- 👋 Hi, I’m @swOk93
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, and I have been learning it on my own on the hyperskill.org platform for more than a year. I want to develop apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin. Before that, I was learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who are studying programming so we can help each other.
- 📫 You can reach me on Facebook - www.facebook.com/swok93/ or email - sw93.ok@gmail.com
